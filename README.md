# JeopardyCalculator

This calculator outlines how much money a contestant can possibly win in a single completely unhinged game of Jeopardy. This would require a contestant to:

- Start with control of the board and never lose it
- Give the correct question for every answer in the Jeopardy round
- Luckily avoid finding the Daily Double until the last possible square
  - Hope that the Daily Double is on a $200 square, and go all-in
- Give the correct question for every answer in the Double Jeopardy round
- Avoid finding the two Daily Doubles until the last two possible squares
  - Hope that the Daily Doubles are both on $400 squares, and go all-in twice in a row
- Go all-in on Final Jeopardy and win!
